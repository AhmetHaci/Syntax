Main OOPs concepts; 
Inheritance - process of subclasses accesing all properties.
             Single/Multilevel/Hierarchial/Multiple ( available only with interfaces),Hybrid(Combination of two or more)

Polymorphism- Process when object can take many from/behaviour.
              Static polymorphism  /Early binding / Compile Time / Achieved by method overloading
              Dynamic polymorphism / Late binding / Run Time    / Achieved by method overriding
              
Abstraction - Process of hiding implementation details.
              Achieved through Abstract classes and Interfaces
              
Encapsulation - process of wrapping variable and method in a single unit. In capsule all medicine are encapsulated inside the capsule. 
                That can be a good example of encapsulation.
